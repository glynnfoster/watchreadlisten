This is a hobby project that I created using a combination of Replit, V0
and Cursor to experiment how quickly I could create a prototype web
application.

In order to use it, you will need to create and set keys for the OMDB
API, Google Books API and Spotify API. All API keys are saved to local
storage. In the case of the Spotify API key, it needs to be of the
form `client_id:client_secret`. If using it in local dev mode, the
callback route should be `http://localhost:3000/spotify-callback`.
